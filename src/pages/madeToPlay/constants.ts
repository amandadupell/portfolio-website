    The largest change came from feedback around our Rattle Bracelet. When conducting user testing, we found that a lot of the steps and pictures were not detailed enough. With more investigation, we determined that the toy was too confusing and needed to be scratched altogether. After further research, we found another toy that aligned with the targeted milestones that the Rattle Bracelet covered. We did a round of user testing with the new toy, ensuring it was easy to understand and make.`,

We also chose to have the guided play immediately follow the toy pages because it made sense when discussing the flow of creating a toy and then finding the activity to use it in.`,

It was amazing to meet and work with the East Boston Social Center, as I feel like our design decisions are driven by a community that benefit from the product we made instead of a “personal project”. 

    Together, we researched, created a design system, user tested, and published a book. The experience was incredibly rewarding, and I am so proud of the final product!`,
